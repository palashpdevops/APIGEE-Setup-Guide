Java:
=====
You need a supported version of Java 1.8 installed on each machine prior to the installation


SELinux
Depending on your settings for SELinux, Edge can encounter issues with installing and starting Edge components. If necessary, you can disable SELinux or set it to permissive mode during installation, and then re-enable it after installation.

Creating the 'apigee' user
The installation procedure creates a Unix system user named 'apigee'. Edge directories and files are owned by 'apigee', as are Edge processes. That means Edge components run as the 'apigee' user. If necessary, you can run components as a different user.


Installation directory:
=======================
By default, the installer writes all files to the /opt/apigee directory. You cannot change this directory location. While you cannot change this directory, you can create a symlink to map /opt/apigee to another location, as described in Creating a symlink from /opt/apigee.

In the instructions in this guide, the installation directory is noted as /opt/apigee


Create the "apigee" user and group:
groupadd -r apigee > useradd -r -g apigee -d /opt/apigee -s /sbin/nologin -c "Apigee platform user" apigee

Create a symlink from /opt/apigee to your desired install root:
ln -Ts /srv/myInstallDir /opt/apigee

Change ownership of the install root and symlink to the "apigee" user:
chown -h apigee:apigee /srv/myInstallDir /opt/apigee


Network setting
Apigee recommendeds that you check the network setting prior to the installation. The installer expects that all machines have fixed IP addresses. Use the following commands to validate the setting:

hostname returns the name of the machine
hostname -i returns the IP address for the hostname that can be addressed from other machines.


TCP Wrappers
TCP Wrappers can block communication of some ports and can affect OpenLDAP, Postgres, and Cassandra installation. On those nodes, check /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny to ensure that there are no port restrictions on the required OpenLDAP, Postgres, and Cassandra ports.

iptables
Validate that there are no iptables policies preventing connectivity between nodes on the required Edge ports.
sudo/etc/init.d/iptables stop


After installing the Edge for Private Cloud, you can check that Cassandra is configured correctly by examining the /opt/apigee/apigee-cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml file. For example, ensure that the Edge for Private Cloud installation script set the following properties:

cluster_name
initial_token
partitioner
seeds
listen_address
rpc_address
snitch


System limits:
=================
Ensure that you have set the following system limits on Cassandra and Message Processor nodes:

On Cassandra nodes, set soft and hard memlock, nofile, and address space (as) limits for installation user (default is "apigee") in /etc/security/limits.d/90-apigee-edge-limits.conf as shown below:

apigee soft memlock unlimited
apigee hard memlock unlimited
apigee soft nofile 32768
apigee hard nofile 65536
apigee soft as unlimited
apigee hard as unlimited
apigee soft nproc 32768
apigee hard nproc 65536

On Message Processor nodes, set the maximum number of open file descriptors to 64K in /etc/security/limits.d/90-apigee-edge-limits.conf as shown below:

apigee soft nofile 32768
apigee hard nofile 65536

# su - apigee
$ ulimit -n
100000


Licensing
Each installation of Edge requires a unique license file that you obtain from Apigee. You will need to provide the path to the license file when installing the management server, for example /tmp/license.txt.

The installer copies the license file to /opt/apigee/customer/conf/license.txt


Starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of Apigee Edge

Stop order
If you install Edge on multiple nodes, then you should stop Edge components on those nodes in the following stop order:

Management Server (edge-management-server)
Message Processor (edge-message-processor)
Postgres Server (edge-postgres-server)
Qpid Server (edge-qpid-server)
Router (edge-router)
Edge UI: edge-ui (classic) or edge-management-ui(new)
Cassandra (apigee-cassandra)
OpenLDAP (apigee-openldap)
PostgreSQL database (apigee-postgresql)
Qpidd (apigee-qpidd)
ZooKeeper (apigee-zookeeper)
Apigee SSO (apigee-sso)
Start order
If you install Edge on multiple nodes, then you should start Edge components on those nodes in the following start order:

Cassandra (apigee-cassandra)
OpenLDAP (apigee-openldap)
PostgreSQL database (apigee-postgresql)
Qpidd (apigee-qpidd)
ZooKeeper (apigee-zookeeper)
Management Server (edge-management-server)
Message Processor (edge-message-processor)
Postgres Server (edge-postgres-server)
Qpid Server (edge-qpid-server)
Router (edge-router)
Edge UI: edge-ui (classic) or edge-management-ui(new)
Edge SSO (apigee-sso)
Start/stop/check all components
The following scripts detect the Apigee components configured to run on the system on which the script is executed, and will start or stop only those components in the correct order for that node.

To stop all Apigee components:

/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all stop
To start all Apigee components:

/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all start
To restart all Apigee components:

/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all restart
To check which components are running:

/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all status
Start/stop/restart individual components
You can use the apigee-service tool to start/stop/restart or check the status of an individual Apigee component on any specific server.


/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service component_name [start|stop|restart|status]

Where component_name identifies the component. Possible values of component_name include (in alphabetical order):

apigee-cassandra (Cassandra)
apigee-openldap (OpenLDAP)
apigee-postgresql (PostgreSQL database)
apigee-qpidd (Qpidd)
apigee-sso (Edge SSO)
apigee-zookeeper (ZooKeeper)
edge-management-server (Management Server)
edge-management-ui (new Edge UI)
edge-message-processor (Message Processor)
edge-postgres-server (Postgres Server)
edge-qpid-server (Qpid Server)
edge-router (Edge Router)
edge-ui (Classic UI)

For example, to start, stop, or restart the Management Server, run the following commands:
/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server start
/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server stop
/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server restart

You can also check the status of an individual Apigee component by using the following command:
/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service component_name status

For example:
/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server status
